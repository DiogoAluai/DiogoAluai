## Me
I am Diogo Aluai, a fullstack Java Software developer. When I'm not working, I let my creativity run to build cool stuff.

### Projects
#### Remote Controller (Android App)
I decided that the time for 'getting up to pause' was over! I had the knowledge to improve this situation, so set out to create an Android app to send 'space' (pause/unpause) commands to my computer. Created both client, server, encrpytion, and ip resolution.
Started by building an Android app (initially without Android Studio, [check out this build script](https://github.com/DiogoAluai/TwoButtons/blob/main/dev_tools/build_and_deploy)). One major issue was that the student residence I was living had 700 rooms, and a complex network where devices' ip changed constantly. To deal with this dynamic ip issue I hosted a custom [registry-service](https://github.com/DiogoAluai/registry-service) in [fly.io](https://fly.io/). 

#### WhatsDown (LAN Messenger Android App)
After a colleague named the concept, I felt the need to build it. Find out more about this story in the [WhatsDown repo](https://github.com/DiogoAluai/WhatsDown).

#### Terminal Markup (ongoing)
Wanted to build a better looking interface for my work convience scripts. Started with learning about [ncurses](https://github.com/DiogoAluai/ncurses), and eventually set out to create a simpler markup language - STML (Simple Text Markup Language). Here is the repo: [stml-render](https://github.com/DiogoAluai/stml-render).

#### Other
Home lab and hardware level adventures is something I also spend time on, however most of these are in private repositories - feel free to ping me to know more :)
